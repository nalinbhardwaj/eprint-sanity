    ePrint Sanity is a web interface that attempts to tame the overwhelming
    flood of papers on IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive. It allows researchers to
    keep track of recent papers, search for papers, sort papers by similarity to
    any paper, see recent popular papers, to add papers to a personal library,
    and to get personalized recommendations of (new or old) ePrint papers.

    Periodically polls ePrint OAI API for new papers. Then allows users to tag
    papers of interest, and recommends new papers for each tag based on SVMs
    over tfidf features of paper abstracts. Allows one to search, rank, sort,
    slice and dice these results in a pretty web UI. Lastly, ePrint Sanity can
    send you daily emails with recommendations of new papers based on your tags.
    Curate your tags, track recent papers in your area, and don't miss out!
